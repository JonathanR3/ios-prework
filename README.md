## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**Reddit**: Smooth scrolling experience without intrusive pop-ups, and simple interface navigation.
**WhatsApp**: Easy integration of attachments, and robust message editing/deletion/forwarding system.
**Discord**: Appealing color palettes, and intuitive interactions with messages (emotes, replies, etc.).

An app idea that I would like to pursue would be a sort of reading/watching list tracker app, essentially something like MyAnimeList, but has a better 
integration of each series you would like to keep track of. It would allow users to directly visit streaming sites to view that show/manga, as well as allow 
an interactive tracker, so that they can get back onto the exact minute or page they left off on that episode/chapter. Moreover, It could include a personalized
assortment of shows and literature that pertain to the user's interest which is generated with machine learning, and provide specific shows based on recent 
trends of their activity. It also could gamify the experience by providing achievemnets, streaks, and reward points, that allow for the user to enhance their
experience on the app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some difficulty in navigating the Xcode interface compared to experiences with VSCode and JetBrains IDEs. Also understanding
how to interact with UI components and assigning variables/functions to them.
